# AI-Store-Trip
This is a JavaScript program that simulates an AI agent going to the store, buying items, and heading home. Perceptrons are used to help the agent make decisions in the program.

Perceptrons are one of the fundamental components of neural networks. Neural networks are part of machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence.

This program uses a few perceptrons to allow the AI agent to make deicisions in the program based on certain factors. The agent has to deal with uncertainity, probability, and 
learning from previous decisions to make future decisions to progress. 

While this is not as complex as other AI programs out there, writing this program has helped me understand artificial intelligence and machine learning better. I have placed
comments throughout StoreTrip.js to help show what is happening in the program.

## How to Run Program
1. Install latest version of Node.js through your terminal, if needed.
2. Install either ```npm i readline``` or ```npm i linebyline``` through your terminal, if needed.
3. Navigate to the directory that you installed StoreTrip.js.
4. Finally, type ```node StoreTrip.js```.
